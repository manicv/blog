***TL;DR - You've all helped me to fulfill a childhood dream of becoming an entertainer. It didn't happen exactly as I thought it would, but it wound up being exactly what I hoped for. Thank you so much.***

These last three years have been the most eventful of my life so far. I bought a car, a house, travelled across the US and to Iceland (twice). I celebrated birthdays and anniversaries, and mourned the losses of friends and family. I met one of my childhood idols. I learned new skills that have served me personally and professionally. And somewhere along the way, I became an EVE celebrity while being mediocre at best at actually playing the game.

I started streaming in 2015 as a joke, because the concept of streaming video games was kind of bizarre to me, and I wanted to poke fun at it. I like deconstructing things and finding humor in the rubble. But I think most people would agree that EVE is not the most fun game to watch. The game relies heavily on long-term strategy, managing several variables to put a particular plan into action. This doesn't make for "edge of your seat" viewing. The exciting parts in EVE are either when all that planning executes perfectly, or it all goes hilariously wrong. And in both cases, that generally happens in the span of just a few minutes. 

So I started thinking up ways to make an EVE stream more active, and more engaging. I started making the kind of content that I would want to watch. I conducted satirical mock interviews with other notable EVE players (voiced by me) surrounding the latest in-game drama or scandal. I recorded commercials for low-budget goods and services that might exist in the EVE universe; the kind of stuff that you would find advertised in the bottom corner on the last page of a tabloid rather than on a holographic billboard in a space station. Sometimes I played the role of the [stooge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farce) between an off-camera A/V engineer working behind the scenes, and a short-tempered duplicate version of myself who would appear on screen to berate for me doing something wrong. 

All the while I would be immediately responsive to the viewers in the chat. No delay. No opsec covering the game. The whole point was to encourage people to actually *watch* the stream. Turns out there's an audience for that kind of thing. I stuck to a regular schedule of streaming for two hours, one night a week. When that week's show was over, I'd start thinking up ideas and writing scripts for the next week's show. 

I started getting invitations to commentate for other streams and events. I was asked to co-host the livestream for EVE Vegas 2016 alongside Rahne and Bam Stroker, and I was accepted to give a [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X_LNrQqCOk) on finding one's place in the EVE community. I was pulled up on stage to sing with Permaband that year.

Then in February of 2017 I had a conversation with CCP Guard, and he asked if I was going to Fanfest that year. He said he had a plan to have a player on stage to co-host the opening ceremony with him. It was the first time CCP had ever done anything like this. And in my naivete', not picking up on the obvious hint, I began giving him a list of players who I felt would be a good fit for the idea.

*"Actually, we want you to do it."*

Things just kind of snowballed from there. I kept saying yes when asked if I wanted to do something.

I kept doing my stream and making [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWaS29ZsK7Y) on Youtube.
