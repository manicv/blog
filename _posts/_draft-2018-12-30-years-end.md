title: Year's End

These last three years have been the most eventful of my life so far. I bought a car, a house, travelled to Iceland (twice), Georgia, Texas, Maryland, and Nevada. I celebrated birthdays and anniversaries, and mourned the losses of friends and family. I met one of my childhood idols. I learned new skills that have served me personally and professionally. And somewhere along the way, I became an EVE celebrity.

I started streaming in 2015 as a joke, because the concept of streaming video games was kind of bizarre to me, and I wanted to poke fun at it. I like drawing attention to the absurdity of things.
